### Monday 18/02/2019

Today we done our free for all to try and get to know more people, and discussing what our goals were for the week. As talking to Oliver, we had similar ideas on what our goals was, and where we were up to. Oliver was doing the natas challanges and bandit levels. I was doing the same thing and we were on the same challanges. We talked on how we solved our challanges, it was assuring that I was talkign to someone who was on the same page and learning experince as I was. 

Oliver's goals for this week was to understand how to gain shell access on his box, and to get better at google searches. As he found that he also tends to not search for the right thing and finding the wrong information. My goals for this week was to get up to the goal on natas and bandit. Learn more about privilege escalation, how it works and some ways to do it, and get a box.
