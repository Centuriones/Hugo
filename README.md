This portfolio contains my reflections and my findings while participating **Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset**.

**What do I want to get out of this unit?**

What I'd like to get out of this summer studio, is the understand more of the technical side of security. I want to understand more how things work and why they work. I feel like that my knowledge is not as compontent as I'd like to be. Things I want to get better at:

* Enumeration: I want to get better at enumeration, because on some challenges or boxes I feel very lost and unsure where to go or where to start. And I tend to fall into rabbit holes. I want to get a better understanding on what I should be looking for. 

* Techincal Knowlege: As stated above, I'd like to understand more about how things work. Understanding how things work will help me learn about certain vulnerabilities and why work the way they do, leading to me giving better advice in the real world, and explaining back to people to help them be more secure.

* Practicing more: This point is more personal. I don't organise my time very well, which leads to alot of procastination. This means I need start using planners, like Notion. 

* Note taking: I'd like to get better at note taking because this will help me in doing CTF's. Writing down what I've done and learnt will be very beneficial to help me understand how things work. This will lead into me remembering why it works and how it works.

* Presenting (Public Speaking): I feel very weak in terms of presenting and public speaking. I need to be more stronger and more confident in the way I talk and explain my ideas. Ways I can get better at public speaking is being more confident, practicing my content.
