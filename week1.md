# Week 1


### Reflection on 4/02/2019

Today we got introduced to the studio, and how the studio was going to run in the next 4 weeks. I felt very excited to start this studio as it will help me learn more of the basics and help me understand where I need to go for this year. I meet my team, and we were assigned a presentation to do. We spent an hour researching what topics we would like to talk about regarding cybersecurity.

The topic we picked was an article about SYN Floods. This was an interesting topic for us to do because personally, I wasn't sure what an SYN Flood was. It was fun researching and understanding how it works and its effect on a business. I learned that an SYN Flood is a DDOS attack which targets available ports and sends constant SYN packets. It exhausts resources like the CPU on the server as the server is constantly expecting a connection to the attacker.

We made a powerpoint for a presentation and started working on it.

### Reflection on 6/02/2019

Today was the day to do our presentations. I was feeling confident in our team's presentation. But once it came to our presentation, my group did well proud of our content and what we spoke about. I felt like my part was lacking as I did research my topic but due to my presentations skills, it felt like I didn't know what I was speaking about. Larry brought this up, as he was wanted to know if I knew what I was talking about or not. This just shows how much confidence and practicing what you're saying comes into a presentation. Since I was stuttering and feeling nervous about the presentation it took the better at me. Even though I did my research, it didn't show in the presentation. So for the next presentation, I need to practice my presentation skills, ways I can do this is speaking to myself or practicing in front of family and getting pointers from there.

Today I was working on my static website as well, I had a lot of troubles with Hugo as I couldn't get the page to run locally. So I decided that I'll just make a GitHub page, for now, just to keep my portfolio up for now. I want to go back to Hugo and give it a proper shot, as I do like the templates and just the general look of the sites. I also want to learn Hugo, so I can help my Father with his website.
