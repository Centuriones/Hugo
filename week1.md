# Week 1

### Reflection on 7/02/2019


Today was the day to do our presentations. I was feeling confident in our teams presentation. But once it came to our presentation, my group did well proud of our contnet and what we spoke about. I felt like my part was lacking as I did research my topic but due to my presentations skills it felt like I didn't know what I was  speaking about. Larry brought this up, as he was wanted to know if I knew what i was talking about or not. This just shows how much confidence and practicing what you're saying comes into a presentaiton. Since i was stuttering and feeling nervous about the presentation it took the better at me. Even though i did my research, it didnt show in the presentation. So for the next presentation, I need to practicing my presention skills, ways i can do this is speaking to myself or  practicing infront of family and getting pointers from there. 

Today I was working on my static website aswell, I had alot of troubles with Hugo as I couldn't get the page to run locally. So I decided that I'll just make a GitHub page for now, just to keep my portfolio up for now. I want to go back to hugo and give it a proper shot, as I do like the templetes and just the general look of the sites. I also want to learn Hugo, so I can help my Father with his website.
