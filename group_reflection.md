**What have we ACHIEVED? – evidence of progress, artefacts created**

As a group we have been working together in the OWSAP Juice CTF, giving each other ideas and teaching each other new things that will help us later on.

We also worked on a presentation together, which was presented in front of Rob, who is part of the Cyber Security community. We presented to him what SYN Floods were, how they work and their effect on a business that is affected by it. As a group, I believe we all did very well, and the feedback Larry gave to all of us individually will be taken, and strengthen us in the future.

**What have we LEARNED? What do we need to Learn?**

We have learned a lot about SYN floods and how they work. We also learned how SQL injections work. We all need to learn how to have better communication as I believe that is the thing that is lacking currently. We can get better at this by using teams more, and constantly asking each other more questions.


**What do we need to do NEXT? collectively – both students and staff**

What we need to next is to get more confident with each other knowing our strengths and weakness so we can compliment each other to help each other grow with cybersecurity and hacking. Regarding staff, I feel like they are doing very good. They are testing our knowledge and wanting us to know more and learn more about hacking and each other.
